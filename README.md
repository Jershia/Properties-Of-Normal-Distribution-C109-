# Properties Of Normal Distribution

# *Learnt About*
  * *In this class we learned about the properties of the normal distribution.*
  * *.**`len()`** helps to find the length of a list, string, dictionary, or any other iterable data format in Python.*
  * *We learnt about ***`format()`*** which helps in formating.An example is given below :point_down:*
     * ***```print("value of list_of_data_within_3_std_deviation is {}%".format(list_of_data_within_3_std_deviation)```***
     * *Here the value of **list_of_data_within_3_std_deviation** would be inserted in the curly brackets **{}***
  * *New traces can be added to a graph object figure using the **`add_trace`*** method.*
  * *We learnt about mean,median,mode and stdev from **statistics** library.* 
  
# *Steps to know about properties of normal distribution*
  * *We got the data by rolling the dice 1000 times*
  * *We imported mean,median,mode and stdev from **Statistics library**.*
  * *We then calculated the mean,median and mode of the data using the statistics library.*
  * *Then we plotted the normal distribution plot*
  * *sd means standard deviation.*
  * *Then we found the count of data points between mean - sd and mean + sd and itâ€™s percentage for first , second and third deviation respectively.*
  * *We found that*
      * *99% of data lie between mean - 3sd and mean + 3sd*
      * *95% of data lie between mean -2sd and mean + 2sd*
      * *68% of data lie between mean - sd and mean + sd*
  * *We calculated the % of data points that lie in 1st,2nd and 3rd deviation*
